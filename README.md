## About Me

Hi! I am José Lucas. I'm passionate about programming and everything that involves precise analysis and creativity.

In addition:
- 🌍 I'm a Economist from Rio de Janeiro, graduated from UFRRJ 🚀
- 💻 A Data Scientist (by nature and dedication)
- 📊 I'm been deeply interested in and committed to learning data science tools. I have been working on projects involving machine learning 🤖, interactive and clear data visualization 📈, and generating precise and innovative insights 💡.

## Fun Facts:
- In my free time, I either play the guitar or act as a midfield dynamo for the team. ⚽🎸

## 🚨What's Here?
In this profile, you will find several projects involving data analysis and data science. I use economic and financial data, econometric modeling (machine learning), and lots and lots of code to achieve this 😉🫡
